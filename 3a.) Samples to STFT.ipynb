    "This notebook converts all `.npy` samples in the directory `.drumData` into STFT features. Unlike, our other feature extraction pipelines (MFCC, MIR and WaveNet) parts of the code in this notebook are adapted from Kyle McDonald's original implementation to make the STFT features work well with TSNE through a series of transformations and edge case checks. We found these to be useful when running the features through TSNE, but they were uneccesary for UMAP. Output dimensiosn per file are (32,32). \n",
